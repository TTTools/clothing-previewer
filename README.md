# Toontown Creative Tools

To download, go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/TTTools/clothing-previewer/releases)

## How to use
* Launch the application executable
* Click Clothing Previewer
* Click Torso, Sleeve, or Bottom texture to import the texture
  * Photoshop files, PNGs, JPEGs, TGAs, Panda TXOs, and DDS files are all supported
    * That means you can just hit save in photoshop whenever you make a change, then press the reload texture button, and you wont have to export to a png or jpeg every time
* When you have made a change to the source texture file, press the RELOAD TEXTURES button to see the changes
* You can view how it will look on the different model types


## Extras
* You can enable experimental features by running the application executable with the --experimental command argument

## About
* These tools were originally developed for Clash, but I have since decided to release them
* I have disabled all but the clothing previewer by default for the time being, as I have some unexpected issues that came up with upgrading to a newer version of the engine (You can still try to use them by using the --experimental launch option)
* The tools are developed using a modified build of Panda3D 1.10.0 (it will likely be updated to the lastest soon) and is written in Python 3.7
